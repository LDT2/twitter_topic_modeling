# Topic Modeling and Trend Analysis of Twitter's Elections Integrity Venezuelan Dataset
Exploratory text analysis to understand the hidden structures and themes of Twitter’s Elections Integrity Datasets

## Purpose
This project focuses on using NLP to understand the topics, themes, and sentiments discussed in Twitter’s Election Integrity Venezuelan Datasets. In the study, I apply unsupervised learning methodologies to conduct exploratory text analysis to unpack the hidden (or latent) structures and relationships in the Twitter dataset. The goal of this study is to demonstrate my ability as a data scientist to take large amounts of raw data, process it, and then tell a compelling story with it. 

This study will focus users’ tweets, retweets, and corresponding metadata to uncover hidden themes and relationships in the data.


## (Developing) Research Questions
- What are the topics and trends discussed in Twitter’s integrity data?
    - How do these topics change over time?
    - Do twitter popularity tags correspond with topics from model?

    - Who are the key players?
